# Sharework Developer Test

This test aims at getting an idea about how candidates fit Sharework's standards in terms of software development.
At Sharework, we do not expect you to master everything we do or use - we are rather looking for people that will rather understand what we want to do and will have good ideas about how to do it, so please use whatever you want to show us your skills!


## Matching

In the matching/ folder, you will find 2 datasets of companies and some of their attributes.

We would like to find the matches between these 2 datasets in the form of a CSV file with the following columns:

dataset_A_id | dataset_B_id | ...
-------------|--------------|-------
| 42 | 137 | You can add column that add information on the match: <br/>- score <br/>- reasons of the match<br/> - anything relevant...
| 12 | 33 |
